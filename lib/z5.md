## Recorders

We can pass in different proxies for different occasions.

First is to record the top level path without evaluating visitor functions, let's call that the TLR (Top Level Recorder).

The TLR never has to resolve to a value as its just there to record path traversals.

The second is a VPR (Visitor Path Recorder), the VPR has to resolve to the actual value at the resolved path.  But also records
what properties were accessed.  By recording the properties we can get a complete list of dependency paths with zero ambiguity.

## TLR

e.g. for this expression:

```js
let animal = animals.use( xs => xs.find( x => x.id === id() ) )
```

We have these possible dependencies


- `id`
- `state`
- `state.animals`
- `state.animals[i]`
- `state.animals[i].id`


And nothing more.

So if someone updates `state.animals[i].nested.id`, we _know_ it wasn't referenced in any predicates, so it doesn't need to affect our `animal` query.  We can create these queries if they haven't yet been created, and cache them for later access, so there is no undefined dependency that we need to potentially lazily bind to later.

For value comparisons, we can return a value that is never equal to any other value, for now we'll use NaN, but we might use a special symbol later.

## VPR

The TLR is really simple, it just mutates a path and never needs to resolve to a value.  But the VPR needs to recursively resolve and rewrap the resolved value while also working with comparisons.

Thoeretically we don't need the VPR to record, as the recording is already doen by the TLR.  But having a VPR allows us to track branching logic based on runtime conditionals.  E.g. if a different branch runs based on Date.now or Math.random or even a state's present value, we need to know those other paths.

Unfortunately we never know if we need a VPR ahead of time, so we always need to use the VPR and never the TLR.
